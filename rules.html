      <h2>Game Play Rules</h2>

      <div class="rule-block">
        <h3>1) Setup &amp; Dealing</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>All players start with 5 cards.</li>
          <li>The player to the left of the dealer begins the round.</li>
          <li>That same player must shuffle the deck at the end of the round.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div class="rule-block">
        <h3>2) Turn Order &amp; Card Pickup</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>At the start of each turn, 2 cards must be picked up.</li>
          <li>If a move is made before picking up the 2 cards, the pickup is voided.</li>
          <li>After picking up cards, the player may play cards or bank cards.</li>
          <li>Properties cannot be banked.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div class="rule-block">
        <h3>3) Hand Size Limit &amp; Discards</h3>
        <p>If a player has more than 7 cards in their hand at the end of their turn:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The other players at the table will randomly choose cards to discard until the hand contains no more than 7 cards.</li>
          <li>Discarded cards are placed into the middle of the deck.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div class="rule-block">
        <h3>4) Card Commitment &amp; Clarifications</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>During your turn, once your hand breaks contact with a card, that action is considered your official play.</li>
          <li>For beginners, the group may decide whether to enforce this rule.</li>
          <li>If clarification is needed and there is discussion about a move <em>before</em> making it, the player may temporarily let the card leave their hand within reason and without gaining a strategic advantage.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div class="rule-block">
        <h3>5) Special Cards &amp; Turn Exceptions</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Playing a “Just Say No” card does not consume a turn, regardless of when it is played.</li>
          <li>“Just Say No” cards only apply to the player using them.</li>
          <li>Flipping a wild property card to a new color counts as one turn.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div class="rule-block">
        <h3>6) Houses &amp; Hotels</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Houses may only be played once a complete property set is formed (excluding utilities and railroads).</li>
          <li>Once a house is placed, hotels may be placed on top.</li>
          <li>Once a house or hotel is banked, it remains in the bank and cannot be used elsewhere.</li>
          <li>If a house is given as monetary value and there is no legitimate place to put it, the house goes directly into the bank.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div class="rule-block">
        <h3>7) Rent &amp; Action Card Rules</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Double the Rent cards may be played before or after a rent card.</li>
          <li>To avoid confusion, players are strongly encouraged to verbalize their move beforehand.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div class="rule-block">
        <h3>8) Colorless Wildcards</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Colorless wildcards have no monetary value and cannot be used as rent payment.</li>
          <li>If a colorless wildcard is not part of a full set, it may be taken using Sly Deal or Forced Deal.</li>
          <li>Colorless wildcards cannot be played on their own and must be attached to a legitimate property or utility.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>If the property attached to a colorless wildcard is taken due to rent:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The wildcard remains the same color.</li>
          <li>The player may not use it to charge rent unless it is part of a legitimate property set.</li>
        </ul>

        <ul>
          <li>Colorless wildcards cannot, by themselves, form an entire property set.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div class="rule-block">
        <h3>9) Card Pickup Errors</h3>
        <p>If a player accidentally takes too many cards:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>If the extra card is unseen, it is placed on top of the deck.</li>
          <li>If the player has seen all cards, the group will randomly select 1–3 cards, reveal it to the group, and shuffle it into the middle of the deck.</li>
        </ul>
