      <div class="rules">
        <h2>1. Setup &amp; Dealing</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>All players start with 5 cards.</li>
          <li>The player to the left of the dealer begins the round.</li>
          <li>That same player must shuffle the deck at the end of the round.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>2. Turn Order &amp; Card Pickup</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>At the start of each turn, 2 cards must be picked up.</li>
          <li>If a move is made before picking up the 2 cards, the pickup is voided.</li>
          <li>After picking up cards, the player may play cards or bank cards.</li>
          <li>Properties cannot be banked.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. Hand Size Limit &amp; Discards</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>If a player has more than 7 cards at end of turn, other players randomly discard down to 7.</li>
          <li>Discarded cards are placed into the middle of the deck.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. Card Commitment &amp; Clarifications</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Once your hand breaks contact with a card, that action is your official play.</li>
          <li>For beginners, the group may decide whether to enforce this rule.</li>
          <li>Rule clarifications are allowed if no strategic advantage is gained.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>5. Special Cards &amp; Turn Exceptions</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>“Just Say No” does not consume a turn.</li>
          <li>“Just Say No” only applies to the player using it.</li>
          <li>Flipping a wild property to a new color counts as one turn.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>6. Houses &amp; Hotels</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Houses only after a complete set (excluding utilities/railroads).</li>
          <li>Hotels may be placed on top of houses.</li>
          <li>Once banked, houses/hotels remain banked.</li>
          <li>If a house is given as value and there’s no valid place, it goes to bank.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>7. Rent &amp; Action Card Rules</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Double the Rent may be played before or after a rent card.</li>

          <li>If not part of full set, can be taken via Sly Deal / Forced Deal.</li>
          <li>Must attach to a legitimate property/utility.</li>
          <li>If attached property is taken due to rent, wildcard stays same color and can’t charge rent unless part of legit property.</li>
          <li>Can’t form a full set by itself.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>9. Card Pickup Errors</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>If extra card is unseen: place on top of deck.</li>
